# ufrj-thesis

A simple program constructed using Python3 and some other libraries made by Bruno Dantas and Pedro Boechat.

This program is a simple web crawler that gets every thesis information and stores it in a database (MongoDB). 


## Important 
The idea is to use this program in another project to improve how the data is shown.


### Run
Running this program is a no-brainer, just follow the guide below:
1. Download all the files.
2. Install all the libraries located at the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt);
3. Create your own .env file and instantiate your database credentials. Please check the [env_utils](https://github.com/DantasB/ufrj-thesis/blob/main/SharedLibrary/env_utils.py);
4. Run the [main.py](https://github.com/DantasB/ufrj-thesis/blob/main/main.py);

### Attention
- Pay attention into any log message if there's any error, check your database credentials;
